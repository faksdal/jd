According to Meeus 1998, in order to calculate the Sun's altitude for a given time on a given date at a given
place, one must:
    - Convert the date and time to Julian Day (Chapter 7)
    - Calculate the Sun's longitude for that instant (Chapter 25)
    - Calculate the Sun's right ascension and declination (Chapter 13)
    - Calculate the sidereal time (Chapter 12)
    - and finally calculate the required altitude of the Sun (Chapter 12)

Holds several classes to calculate the Sun's position on the sky.
